# Data-Driven Analytics of Email Marketing Performance

I originally completed this work in November 2016 as a personal project and have now decided to share it with the public.

Enjoy! :)

**Data source:**
Source shall remain anonymous.

**Note:** If an error occurs when rendering the file [email-campaign.ipynb](./email-campaign.ipynb), it appears to be caused by an internal bug in Github. Please copy and paste the URL of that file from Github to [Jupyter nbviwer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to view the rendered notebook or try this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/davidkml/email-campaign/blob/master/email-campaign.ipynb) instead.
